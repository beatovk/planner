Coffee here leans Brazilian Arabica – smooth, balanced, and brewed with care. The real standout? Morgen classic, a freshly baked financier that’s buttery, soft and just sweet enough to leave a mark. What sets the place apart is how the light moves through it – brushing against textured walls, mixing with the scent of fresh brewed coffee in the air.

That’s exactly the vibe of this tucked-away cafe just off Rama 2 Road. Honestly, we’re probably all a bit like that ‘fell boy’, sneaking away to find some chill time. Outside, a lush tropical garden bursts with greenery, creating a contrast to the dry concrete jungle beyond. Inside, warm wood tones and mid-century furniture set a soft, inviting mood. Huge windows frame a small garden nook, blurring the line between indoors and out. Coffee-wise, the cafe keeps it local with Thai beans roasted by Midsummer, offering both light and medium roasts. But if you’re not a coffee fan, their ceremonial-grade matcha is a standout, especially yame clear matcha, which has subtle smokey notes that linger perfectly.Address:100, 16, Rama II Rd, Bang Nam Chuet, Mueang Samut Sakhon. 098-283- 0885.

Piccolo Vicolo brings a clean, contemporary pulse to Wang Burapha without losing the old‑town mood. Three adjoining, four‑storey shophouses by Khlong Ong Ang – once a machine storage site – now read as a calm, community‑minded hideout where the original structure meets lush greenery. The layout is smart: a coffee-and-pastry bar with indoor and outdoor seating on the first floor; a library‑like co‑working room on the second floor; an open, plant‑filled terrace with city views on the third; and a surprise on fourth floor – a private‑suite stay called Poco House. The concept leans ‘Discovery & Treasuring,’ preserving original structure while softening it with greenery and quiet corners. The menu suits slow sessions: specialty coffee alongside matcha, sodas and light brunch. Don’t miss the Matcha Coconut or the house Raspberry Soda – both crowd highlights – plus cakes and tarts for the sweet tooth.

Despite its specialty leanings, prices lean gentle: an americano starts at B60, and even an Ethiopian pour, bright with berry, stays within reach.

It stands on a patch of ground already busy with cafes, wine rooms and shops that deal in pens as if they were jewellery. The structure itself is all clarity – confident angles, open spans – but inside the air softens. Low-lit corners appear ready for long afternoons, while furniture feels chosen rather than bought, each piece placed with intent rather than instinct. There’s a sense of lingering here, a pace that resists Bangkok’s usual sprint, where you can watch the light crawl across the floor and feel, just for a moment, that staying put counts as an activity.Address:38 Charoen Chai Alley, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana. 082-925-6365.

      "description": "Later that night, I wondered – was I being dramatic for wanting to go back again tomorrow? But when the memory of the Pork Kim-cheese Toastie resurfaces, I know I’m not. Homemade kimchi, melty cheese, and thick-cut sourdough (baked in-house by Sarnies) come together in a perfect storm of flavour. It's crunchy, tangy, savoury – dreamy, even.This space is what happens when two rule-breakers decide to rewrite the clean-eating script.Pimp My SaladandSarnies. One built its name on bowls that are vibrant, nutrient-dense and full of personality; the other is known for turning the everyday cafe experience into something bold and unapologetically flavorful.The space itself is bathed in natural light all day long. Ideal for catch-ups over brunch or those spontaneous candid IG stories. But back to the food:Nutty Acai Bowlis the real post-toast finisher. Sure, acai is known as a superfood, but this bowl is also super tasty. Topped with a chunky raw brownie that’s 100% plant-based, gluten-free and dairy-free. Zero guilt, zero sugar spikes – just whole, thoughtful ingredients. And if you're not in the mood for toast or smoothie bowls, don’t skip Hula-Hula Tuna. Chilli miso ponzu gives it this bold, spicy depth right from the first bite. It’s layered but not overwhelming – savoury, tangy, a little sweet. Their house-made kimchi adds a nice kick. It's a masterclass in clean eating with intent: every element feels considered, from texture to taste to how it makes you feel afterward. And all ingredients are free from preservatives and artificial flavourings.L/F, Emporium Tower. 094-218-0688. Open daily 7am-7pm",

What started as a small meal delivery service, where the founders chopped, packed and hand-delivered everything themselves, has now bloomed into a full-fledged flagship in the heart of Sukhumvit. And honestly? I feel weirdly proud of them. If you’re the type who tracks your protein intake like it's a second job, this is your spot. Good Roots doesn't just offer healthy food – it offers functional food. Think nutrient-dense meals, with macros that matter. Most dishes boast 20-45 grams of protein, and their shakes? A muscle-building 70 grams per serving. That’s not just impressive, it’s intentional. Each menu item includes detailed nutrition info, making it an easy yes for anyone who’s serious about health goals but still wants flavour.And then there’s the sourcing: local, thoughtful and sustainable. In a world dominated by global supply chains and mass production, Good Roots chooses to support small farmers. That alone is enough to make you feel good. Their philosophy? Don’t just eat good. Feel good. With food made from unrefined, minimally processed, plant-forward ingredients, they’re bringing nourishment back to the kitchen and straight to the table.My absolute favourite? Miso Yuzu Salmon. The veggie mix is vibrant and fresh, but it’s the shoyu-miso dressing that steals the spotlight – savory, tangy, with just the right umami kick. Chopped almonds add crunch to every bite, while the salmon is cooked just right. Light but deeply satisfying, this dish checks all the gut and heart-health boxes. Then there’s Mediterranean salmon salad – the kind of meal that powers you through the day without the 4pm snack crash. Packed with lean protein and fibre, it’s both hearty and hydrating.1/F, Sathorn Square, 98 N Sathon Rd, Si Lom, Bang Rak. 080-920-7778.  Open Mon-Fri 7.30am-7.30pm, Sat-Sun 9am-5pm",

It’s the kind of place people usually talk about for their colourful smoothies – bright, Instagrammable, too pretty to drink – but what surprised me was what sat behind the rainbow: real food, minimally processed, built with purpose. Their philosophy is simple but bold: health is the ultimate wealth. And here, that means no refined sugar, gluten and dairy, just ingredients that feel like they were chosen with intentional love and absolute care.Then came the PB&J smoothie. I wondered, is it possible to fall in love with a drink? Because this one had me. As someone who’s had one too many chalky, fake-tasting ‘healthy’ blends, this was a revelation. Just real peanut butter, real fruit, no weird aftertaste –  the childhood sandwich reimagined by someone who also reads nutrition labels for fun.At Plantiful, everything is built around real nourishment. They focus on nutrient pillars: plant-based protein, good fats, sulfur-rich vegetables and the ‘eat rainbow’ approach that shows up on nearly every plate. Spicy kimchi soba salad is a perfect example – zesty, cooling, with house-made kimchi and a chorus of veggies in every colour. It’s a dish I’d turn to when I want to feel clean and light, especially at the end of a long day when I need something friendly for my digestive system.So I sat there, sipping my smoothie, nibbling my eggplant maki, and I couldn’t help but wonder to myself in a Carrie Bradshaw voice-over: if food can make us feel this good, why do we ever settle for less?GF/F, Amarin Plaza, Phloen Chit Rd, Lumphini, Pathum Wan. 084-507-7887.

Tucked into a space with mid-century charm and earthy character, it ditches the sleek white aesthetic of typical wellness cafes in favour of something more honest, more grounded. It began as a personal journey: Tan, the founder, struggled with chronic fatigue and thyroid issues, and started juicing as a form of healing. Her blends worked so well that friends began asking for bottles, and the rest is poured, bottled, and served here.What struck me most is how everything here is made with care, not convenience. From the cold-pressed juices to the way they source their ingredients – this isn’t healthy food in a hurry. It’s a slow, conscious way of living. They support small-scale tea and produce farmers across Thailand who still harvest, blend, and press the artisanal way – by hand, in rhythm with the land. Veggiology builds its menu around real, thoughtful ingredients that aren’t dressed up or disguised. What you see is what you sip, and they’re refreshingly upfront about everything that goes into your glass or on your plate. Their juice blends strike a rare balance – dense with nutrients but never hard to drink. Each is a carefully crafted mix of vegetables and fruits that feels both functional and flavourful. No added sugar, no water, no thickeners – just the goodness of what nature grew, pressed and poured into your day. The juice flight is a signature here: ten organically grown juice shots that let you explore and decide for yourself which one is worth a bigger shot.More than anything, Veggiology wants you to feel good – not just physically, but spiritually too. They believe that when food is grown with respect for nature, and prepared with care, it brings you back to something essential. Something grounded.

Each bite is a little different, but every one is full of flavour and intention.Then there’s spicy tuna pesto and cheddar sourdough sandwich, made with naturally fermented sourdough and thoughtfully crafted grains instead of plain rice. The tuna? Fragrant, soft and somehow comforting. The bread has that slight chew of real sourdough, and the whole thing feels wholesome without being heavy.And just when you think you’re done, you remember:Makailives here too. Grain has partnered with one of the most trusted names in Bangkok’s acaí game. As an acai enthusiast, I’ve chased bowls across cities, countries and continents – and this one ticks every single box. Real, pure acai imported straight from Brazil – not powder, not syrupy puree. Just the real deal, served cold and topped with fresh fruit, house-made nut butter and all the right textures.

I cherish how flavourful it is – full of texture from mushrooms and kelp noodles, with the spicy dressing that’s addictive in the best way. It’s become such a staple in my week that I legit forget it’s vegetarian. A new favourite that I’ll definitely be ordering again from now on is sen kaew suki haeng – dry-style sukiyaki kelp noodles stir-fried with duck egg and veggies like baby corn and carrots in a fragrant suki sauce. It smells incredible and tastes even better. And of course, pad buab num nim (stir-fried sponge gourd with duck egg) never lets me down. It’s my comfort dish – especially on days when I want to eat light but still feel wholesome. The natural sweetness of the gourd mixed with the richness of duck egg is a simple kind of perfection, especially over warm rice.Every time I eat here, I’m reminded that this isn’t just a healthy food brand – it’s a story of change.Puckchummwas born from the founder’s childhood dislike of vegetables, and later, from the impact of COVID-19. When lockdowns hit, event staff fromDiamond Grains Bowlwere out of work – and so this new venture was created, offering them a second chance while challenging the idea that vegetable-based meals are bland or boring. It started with one realization: she didn’t hate vegetables – she just hated vegetables that weren’t cooked well.That’s why everything at Puckchumm is cooked with care, without oil and MSG, using only water and fresh ingredients. And the love shows. You’ll often find a bonus piece of fak tong kleuab khai (egg-glazed pumpkin) tucked into your delivery box – because it’s pumpkin season, and because giving a little extra is just part of how they do things.Open for delivery only",

Every dish is built on locally sourced ingredients, and behind every plate is a smile from somewhere in Thailand. Homeland is one of those places where the food feels like it comes with a story – and in this case, it legitimately does. Every dish here is a collaboration between Thai farmers, producers and makers. Nothing is standardized here: not the shape of the pumpkin, the shade of the eggshell, or the size of the okra. That’s the beauty of it. They don’t pressure local suppliers to meet rigid cosmetic standards. Instead, they celebrate the unpredictability of seasons and nature, and everything that comes with it.The space feels incredibly homey, almost like eating at your grandmother’s kitchen table (if your grandmother were quietly chic). There’s warmth in the walls. Thai pumpkin soup is what I’ll be ordering again next time – no question. It’s so fresh, so simple, but deeply comforting. The aftertaste is heavenly with the texture of spiced pumpkin seeds and local goat’s cheese, and a little hint of tamarind sauce that makes it land in the right spot.Every dish here tells a story. The Thai Sansai Pasta features organic Thai vegetables like pak kood (edible fern) and okra, tossed into a comforting bowl of flavors you don’t usually find in a pasta dish. TheHummus & Eggscame with poached organic eggs, creamy hummus and sourdough from their neighbours at Larder. A reminder that supporting locals can be as simple as sharing bread across the alley.I had a quick chat with the owner, and it stayed with me until today. She’s not here to preach about clean eating or push some wellness ideals. She even said it herself: Homeland isn’t a clean-eating place. It’s a conscious one. Everything about it – imperfect produce, seasonal unpredictability, dishes that shift slightly depending on the week – comes from that belief.On the wall, I noticed portraits of the local farmers and suppliers they work with – faces full of pride, hands that grew what I was eating. And I don’t know – something about that made me feel not just full, but fulfilled. Homeland reminded me that food doesn’t need to be fancy to matter. It just needs to come from somewhere real.

Let’s just say it might be my most ordered bowl of all time.Their acai is made from single origin acai berries straight from the Amazon Rainforest, which means it’s consistent in both taste and quality – every time. And yes, it’s not just pretty; it’s powerful. Acai is a true superfood: high in fiber, low in calories, loaded with antioxidants, plus it helps with digestion, skin health and even muscle recovery. Basically, a workout dessert with benefits. I often order an acai bowl as a meal replacement – especially when I want something fun but functional.Acai yoghurt swirl is one of my favourites. The yoghurt and acai base complement each other – it’s creamy, slightly chewy and not too sour. You can order the yoghurt on its own if you want extra protein as it contains up to 14 grams per cup. I usually get this when I want something light but still filling. It works as a snack or a meal, especially after a workout. Definitely one of my top picks.Fudge mochi bowl is a must. The mochi is soft, warm and fudgy – especially good when enjoyed hot on top of cold acai. Their homemade chocolate sauce is solid, but it’s the mochi that got me. I went back three days later just to have it again. If you like your chocolate more intense, try oh, fudge!

The owner has been eating vegan since she was 16, and her vision was simple: create a place where going vegan doesn’t mean giving up taste. She knew that one of the biggest reasons people hesitate to switch is the lack of truly satisfying options. So she built this place to prove that vegan food can hit hard – with flavour, not just ethics. Most of the menu is Thai, which honestly had me wondering how they’d pull it off. Thai food is bold, layered, unapologetic, and that’s not always easy to do without meat or fish sauce. But somehow, they nailed it. The food doesn’t feel like a whole imitation. It feels like a reminder that flavour doesn’t have to come from animal products.There was a moment that actually made me laugh. I bit into the croissant with minced ‘beef’ and salsa and halfway through realized I was eating what felt exactly like real meat. As a non-beef eater, I panicked for a second. Then I remembered – oh right, this place is 100% vegan. Crisis averted.Khao soi poo is another standout. Ingredients mimic the taste and texture of crab, but it never feels gimmicky. The dish I keep thinking about? Pad pak boong moo krob. Instead of crispy pork belly, they use tofu, and no, it doesn’t taste exactly like pork – but it doesn’t need to. It has its own kind of crunch, its own richness, and it still hits that satisfying spot.Kem-Kon has big plans too. With support from the government, the goal is to bring this version of Thai vegan food to a global audience. Veganism is already growing fast around the world, and Thai food isn’t just for Thai people anymore. Kem-Kon is betting on that – and honestly, we’re rooting for them.",

Their ingredients are thoughtfully sourced, the cows are grass-fed, the chickens are cage-free, the fish are line-caught from Thai coastal fisheries in Prachuap. Even the beef is from a regenerative farm in Australia with a zero-carbon footprint. Everything, down to the bakery items they source from their neighbour Congky in Ekkamai, is traced and considered. The space matches the energy: cosy and bathed in warm light, with just enough raw industrial edge to feel cool, but still soft enough to stay all day.

It ties everything together so cleanly that you barely notice how many textures and flavours are dancing around at once. It’s refreshing and full of contrast: soft and crunchy, sweet and savoury, creamy and acidic, and I mean it when I say: I actually left no crumbs. 10/10. Poke bowl is also one to come back for. Half Italian, half Japanese, it’s loaded with line-caught fish marinated in koji and house-made teriyaki (all the sauces and pickles made in-house, by the way).
